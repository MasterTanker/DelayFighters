need to add a 'config.json' file that is a dictionary with "channel_name" "account_name" and "oauth_token"

example:
{
	"account_name": miziziziz,
	"channel_name": miziziziz,
	"oauth_token": asdasdjkhk
}


My Take on Platswarmers

Added some tiles to the editor and changed almost all the art.

The editor has more bugs now.
